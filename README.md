Master of Science Degree in Computer Science
During our era, nobody was willing to share their knowledge for free. What was available were free Youtube playlists and several other unstructured curricula. All the free structured programs like Linda are now premiums courses which people cannot afford unless you have some good cash.
With this shorateg comes motivation of us starting open universities to curbe the learning challenges.

Welcome to this free open Masters of Science program.

The objectives of the programme are to:
•	create new opportunities for postgraduate research in Computer Science
•	contribute to the production of Computer Science professionals required at the various levels of our industrial development.
•	inculcate a proactive and relevant information communication technology (ICT) research and development community.
•	foster national and regional collaboration in Computer Science
•	collaborate with industry to develop ICT products, systems and services that address key economic needs.
•	produce high quality education, research, systems and products that competes effectively at the global level.
•	provide an exit point in the form of a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science for those candidates who do not wish to undertake a substantive project upon successful completion of the core course units.

Entry Requirements
•	The common regulations for the Masters degree in all faculties shall apply.
•	The minimum requirements for eligibility into the Master of Science in Computer Science are:
•	Holders of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, of at least Upper Second Class Honours or an equivalent qualification..
•	Holders of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Lower Second Class Honours or an equivalent qualification. In addition, the applicant should have at least 2 years relevant experience.
•	Holders of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Pass degree or an equivalent qualification. In addition the applicant should have at least 4 years relevant experience.
•	Holders of a Bachelor's degree in a related discipline Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics and Physics of at least Upper Second Class Honours or an equivalent qualification. In addition the candidate must hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science, of a minimum Credit grade or an equivalent qualification from an institution recognised by Senate.

Examination Regulations
All taught course units shall be examined at the end of the respective semesters.
A candidate for the degree shall satisfactorily complete such coursework and practical assignments as may be required for the scheme of study. Satisfactory completion of any such requirements shall be a condition of admission to the examination at the end of that semester of study.
A written examination for a course unit shall have a minimum duration of three hours.
Each course unit or its equivalent shall be graded independently out of a maximum of 100 marks and the pass mark shall be 50%.
The complete assessment of a taught unit shall consist of course work (assignments, laboratories and continuous assessment tests) and a compulsory written examination.  The contribution towards the unit aggregate shall be 50% for course work and 50% for written examination.
A candidate who fails to satisfy the examiners in any unit(s), may on the recommendation of the Board of Examiners and approval by Senate, be allowed to take up to two re-sit/retake examinations in the unit(s) failed during the ordinary examination time, within the stipulated study period.
A pass obtained in any re-sit examination will be recorded as 50% in the candidate's academic record.
A candidate shall be required to pass in all the taught course units before being allowed to undertake the research project.
The project shall be graded independently out of a maximum of 100 marks and the pass mark shall be 50%.
A pass obtained in any resubmitted project will be recorded as 50%
A candidate who fails to satisfy the examiners in the project may, on the recommendation of the Board of Examiners and approval by Senate, be allowed to resubmit the project not more than twice. Any re-submission(s) must be done within a period of two consecutive semesters starting from the first submission.
The grading system of individual courses will be as follows:
A     75% - 100%
B      65% - 74%
C     50% -     64%
F      below 50%
