Master of Science Degree in Computer Science<br>
During our era, nobody was willing to share their knowledge for free. What was available were free Youtube playlists and several other unstructured curricula. All the free structured programs like Linda are now premiums courses which people cannot afford unless you have some good cash.<br>
With this shorateg comes motivation of us starting open universities to curbe the learning challenges.<br>

Welcome to this free open Masters of Science program.<br>

The objectives of the programme are to:<br>
* create new opportunities for postgraduate research in Computer Science
•	contribute to the production of Computer Science professionals required at the various levels of our industrial development.
•	inculcate a proactive and relevant information communication technology (ICT) research and development community.
•	foster national and regional collaboration in Computer Science
•	collaborate with industry to develop ICT products, systems and services that address key economic needs.
•	produce high quality education, research, systems and products that competes effectively at the global level.
•	provide an exit point in the form of a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science for those candidates who do not wish to undertake a substantive project upon successful completion of the core course units.

Entry Requirements
•	The common regulations for the Masters degree in all faculties shall apply.
•	The minimum requirements for eligibility into the Master of Science in Computer Science are:
•	Holders of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, of at least Upper Second Class Honours or an equivalent qualification..
•	Holders of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Lower Second Class Honours or an equivalent qualification. In addition, the applicant should have at least 2 years relevant experience.
•	Holders of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Pass degree or an equivalent qualification. In addition the applicant should have at least 4 years relevant experience.
•	Holders of a Bachelor's degree in a related discipline Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics and Physics of at least Upper Second Class Honours or an equivalent qualification. In addition the candidate must hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science, of a minimum Credit grade or an equivalent qualification from an institution recognised by Senate.

Course Structure and Duration
• Each academic year shall have three semesters of 15 weeks each.
• The programme shall extend over a minimum of four semesters and a maximum of twelve semesters
• The Master of Science in Computer Science shall be offered by coursework, examination and project.
• The programme shall consist of twelve and a half taught course units and the project.
• For those opting to exit with a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science, the programme shall consist of nine and a half compulsory course units and a project
• A course unit shall be defined as 60 contact hours comprising of lectures, tutorials and laboratories.
• A candidate shall take nine and a half compulsory course (units) and three electives.
• The choice of the three electives shall be approved by the School.
• The research project shall be equivalent to six course units.
• For those opting to exit with a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science, the research project shall be equivalent to two course units.
• A candidate shall be required to take a minimum of two course units and a maximum of four course units in any given semester.
