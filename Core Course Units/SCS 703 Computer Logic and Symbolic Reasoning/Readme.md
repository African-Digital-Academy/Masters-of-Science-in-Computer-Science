* Propositions, statements, and arguments.
* Logical connectives: AND, OR, NOT.
* Truth tables.
  
Module 2: Propositional Logic (8 hours)

* Propositional calculus.
* Syntax and semantics of propositional logic.
* Logical equivalences and tautologies.
* Normal forms: Conjunctive and Disjunctive Normal Forms.
  
Module 3: Predicate Logic (10 hours)
