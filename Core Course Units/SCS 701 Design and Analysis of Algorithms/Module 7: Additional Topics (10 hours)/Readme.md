<p><b>Topic 1:- Advanced Data Structures</b><br>
Introduction to Advanced Data Structures:<br>

Advanced data structures play a vital role in computer science and are essential for efficiently managing and manipulating data in various applications.

These data structures are designed to optimize specific operations and trade-offs in terms of time and space complexity.

Examples of Advanced Data Structures:

1. Skip Lists:

Skip lists are a data structure that maintains a sorted list of elements. They use multiple layers of linked lists with different skip distances to speed up search operations.<br>
Key operations include insertion, deletion, and search, all of which have an average time complexity of O(log n).<br>

2.B-Trees:

B-trees are a balanced tree structure used in databases and file systems. They are optimized for disk access and can efficiently perform insertion, deletion, and search operations.<br>
B-trees maintain balance by redistributing data among nodes during insertion and deletion, ensuring that the tree remains height-balanced.

3. Trie (Prefix Tree):

A trie is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of data with keys. Tries are particularly useful for tasks like autocomplete and spell checking.
Tries have fast retrieval times for tasks involving string keys and can support operations like insertion, deletion, and prefix matching.<br>

4. Splay Trees:

Splay trees are self-adjusting binary search trees. When an element is accessed, it is moved to the root of the tree, reducing access times for frequently used elements.<br>
Splay trees are particularly useful for caching and memory management.<br>

<p> Choosing the Right Data Structure:</p>

Selecting the appropriate data structure for a specific task is a critical decision in algorithm and software design.

The Boyer-Moore algorithm is another efficient string matching algorithm that utilizes two heuristics, the bad character rule and the good suffix rule, to skip unnecessary character comparisons.<br>
It can have an average time complexity of O(m + n) and is considered one of the fastest string matching algorithms in practice.

4. Rabin-Karp Algorithm:

The Rabin-Karp algorithm employs hashing to compare the pattern with substrings of the text. It is particularly useful for multiple pattern matching and can have an average time complexity of O(m * n).
